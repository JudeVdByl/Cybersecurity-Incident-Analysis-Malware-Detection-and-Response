#  Incident Response and Malware Analysis: Uncovering the "pRsm.dll" Threat in Financial Sector Cybersecurity

## Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of a cybersecurity incident involving the detection and response to a malware attack targeting a financial institution. The primary focus is on identifying the malicious files, understanding their behavior, and implementing effective mitigation strategies to neutralize the threat.

## Skills Learned

- **Malware Analysis**: Developed skills in extracting file hashes, analyzing malware behavior, and identifying malware frameworks.
- **Incident Response**: Enhanced abilities in executing a structured approach to incident response, from initial detection through to remediation.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Gained experience in utilizing OSINT and correlating findings with global threat intelligence databases.
- **Tool Proficiency**: Improved proficiency with cybersecurity tools like CyberChef, VirusTotal, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Tools Used

- **Virtual Machine (VM)**: An isolated environment used for safely analyzing the malware samples.
- **CyberChef**: Utilized to safely defang malicious URLs and IP addresses.
- **VirusTotal**: Employed to verify file hashes and gain further insights into the nature of the malware.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: Referenced to map malware components to known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
- **DocIntel Platform**: Used for accessing and managing incident details and supporting evidence.

## Steps

1. **Scenario Setup**: Initiated the process by accessing a secure VM and logging into the DocIntel platform, where all relevant files and tools were available (Figure 1). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f10c8be7-1793-4a98-b8d0-b75741252a45 "https://tryhackme.com/r/room/fridayovertime")

2. **File Hashing**: Generated the SHA1 hash for the `pRsm.dll` file located in the `samples.zip` archive using the Linux command line within the VM (Figure 2). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e78150b-6a8c-4f89-824d-4338aa03f1e8 "https://tryhackme.com/r/room/fridayovertime")

    ```bash
    sha1sum pRsm.dll
    ```

3. **Malware Identification**: Leveraged VirusTotal to cross-reference the extracted hash, identifying the associated malware framework and any related modules (Figure 3). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e4591a2-ef3b-48ed-a4f9-49f7160179f3)


4. **MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping**: Mapped the identified malware components to corresponding MITRE ATT&CK techniques, providing insights into the methods used by the threat actors.

5. **URL and IP Address Defanging**: Utilized CyberChef to defang potentially harmful URLs and IP addresses related to the malware’s command and control (C&C) infrastructure, ensuring they were safe for further analysis (Figure 4).

6. **Further Research**: Conducted further research into the malware’s capabilities and its affiliation with advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. This was informed by a detailed report on the Evasive Panda APT group, which is known for deploying sophisticated malware to target high-profile entities (ESET, 2023). This research provided a broader context to the malware's functionality and its strategic deployment in cyber espionage activities.

## Supporting Evidence

The project utilized a combination of direct analysis within the VM and supporting research from external sources. The article from WeLiveSecurity on the Evasive Panda APT group was particularly instrumental in understanding the broader implications of the detected malware. Figures referenced above showcase the step-by-step process followed during the incident analysis, with relevant screenshots providing visual evidence of the investigation and findings.

## Conclusion

This project underscored the importance of a methodical and informed approach to cybersecurity incident response. By combining practical malware analysis techniques with comprehensive threat intelligence, I effectively identified and neutralized a significant security threat. The use of advanced tools and frameworks was crucial in ensuring a successful outcome, demonstrating the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the field of cybersecurity.
